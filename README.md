# DIABLO_Integration-of-multiomics
Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent Components 
It’s a supervised machine learning method used to integrate multiple omics datasets measured on the same samples (N-integration) to: 

Classify samples into different groups (classes), 

Identify biologically meaningful features (genes, proteins, methylation markers, etc.) that contribute to this classification, 

Create a multi-omics signature predictive of new unseen samples. 

So it identifies the genes that are imp to classify the ground samples and Flight samples 

 

DIABLO includes sparsity, meaning it will select only important features per dataset — the ones that: 

Correlate well with features in other datasets, 

Discriminate between the outcome classes (e.g., Ground vs Spaceflight). 

Help you understand which genes/proteins/CpG sites are most important, 

Show how they jointly distinguish spaceflight vs ground, 

And provide a multi-omics biomarker signature.
